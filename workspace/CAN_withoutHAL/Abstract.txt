The CAN project is a simple demo program for 
ST 'STM32F407VG' microcontroller using ST 'STM32F4-Discovery' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL     =             8 MHz
   - SYSCLK   =           168 MHz
   - HCLK     = SYSCLK  = 168 MHz
   - APB1 CLK = CAN CLK =  42 MHz

Core Clock: for Serial Wire Viewer is 168 MHz.

 - CAN controller speed: 500 kbits
 - send converted changing value in first byte in CAN message
   from CAN controller #2 to CAN Controller #1 

This example shows how to use CAN peripheral.


The CAN example is available in different targets:

  STM32F407 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)

  STM32F407 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)


Note: A loopback between CAN1 and CAN2 is necessary for this demo.

A Tiny Network without Transceiver ICs:
Sometimes you have a CAN equipped processor on a low cost board but it has no CAN transceiver chips.
Here is a method that can be used to create a small experimental network with such a board.  
There will be no noise immunity and you might have to lower the speed….but many experimenters have made this work satisfactorily.  
Use a signal diode similar to 1N914 or 1N4148.  Power supply diodes usually do not have a fast enough recovery time for CAN to function.
